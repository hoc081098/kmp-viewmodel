   * - This scope is `androidx.lifecycle.viewModelScope` from AndroidX.

   *

   *
   * ### Other platforms
   * - This scope is bound to the first available in the order:
   *   [Dispatchers.Main.immediate][kotlinx.coroutines.MainCoroutineDispatcher.immediate] or
   *   [Dispatchers.Main][kotlinx.coroutines.MainCoroutineDispatcher].
   *
   *   You should make sure that you add the corresponding dependency to your project,
   *   to ensure that the [kotlinx.coroutines.MainCoroutineDispatcher] is available
   *   (eg. `kotlinx-coroutines-swing`, `kotlinx-coroutines-javafx`, ...).
   *
   * - It is created lazily, and can be accessed from any thread (it is thread-safe).
