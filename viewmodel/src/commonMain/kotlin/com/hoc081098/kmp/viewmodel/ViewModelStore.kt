 * Class to store `ViewModel`s.

 * if an owner of this `ViewModelStore` is destroyed and recreated due to configuration
 * changes, new instance of an owner should still have the same old instance of
 * `ViewModelStore`.
 *
 * If an owner of this `ViewModelStore` is destroyed and is not going to be recreated,
 * then it should call [clear] on this `ViewModelStore`, so `ViewModel`s would
 * be notified that they are no longer used.
